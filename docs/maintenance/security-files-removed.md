# ðŸš¨ Security Files Removed

The following files contained hardcoded credentials and have been flagged for removal:

## Files with Security Issues:
1. `scripts/seed-firebase.js` - Contains hardcoded Firebase API keys
2. `src/services/firestoreSeed.js` - Contains hardcoded passwords

## Why These Files Are Dangerous:
- **API Keys Exposed**: Anyone with repository access can see your Firebase credentials
- **Hardcoded Passwords**: Default passwords are visible in plaintext
- **Security Risk**: Could allow unauthorized access to your Firebase project

## Replacement Solution:
- Environment variables are now configured in `.env` file
- Firebase configuration is properly secured
- Seeding should be done through Firebase Console or secure server-side scripts

## What to Do:
**IMMEDIATELY DELETE THESE FILES:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd "d:\For study\major2\Major Project2_ KNEA\WEB_Campus\campusnex"

# Delete dangerous files
Remove-Item "scripts\seed-firebase.js" -Force
Remove-Item "src\services\firestoreSeed.js" -Force
```

## Verification:
After deletion, verify your app still works:
```bash
npm start
```

The app should continue to function normally because:
- Firebase config is now in `.env` file (secure)
- `src/services/firebase.js` already uses environment variables
- No production code depends on these seed files

## Note:
If you need to seed data in the future:
1. Use Firebase Console directly
2. Create server-side seeding scripts (not in React app)
3. Never commit credentials to version control
