## Getting Started with the UI Components

To use the new UI components in your code:

```javascript
// Import components from the UI library
import { Button, Card, Input, Badge } from './components/ui';

// Use components in your JSX
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card variant="elevated">
      <h2>My Card Title</h2>
      <p>This card uses the new design system.</p>
      <Input 
        label="Username" 
        placeholder="Enter your username" 
      />
      <div className="flex space-x-2 mt-4">
        <Badge variant="primary">New</Badge>
        <Button variant="primary">Submit</Button>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
