# CampusNex - Architecture Update

## Architecture Overview

CampusNex has been completely refactored from direct Firebase integration to a proper three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend (Presentation Layer)** - React application
2. **Backend (Business Logic Layer)** - Node.js/Express server
3. **Database (Data Layer)** - PostgreSQL relational database

This refactoring addresses all of the advisor's requirements by:
1. ✅ Removing all direct database access from the frontend
2. ✅ Implementing a relational database (PostgreSQL)
3. ✅ Creating a dedicated backend server for all database operations
4. ✅ Establishing proper authentication and authorization with JWT

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Backend Server
- ✅ Node.js/Express server with RESTful API endpoints
- ✅ JWT authentication with secure token handling
- ✅ Role-based access control (student, organizer, admin)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ API rate limiting for security
- ✅ CORS configuration for frontend access

### 2. Database Implementation
- ✅ PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- ✅ Complete relational schema with proper constraints
- ✅ Foreign key relationships between tables
- ✅ Database migrations for versioned schema changes
- ✅ Transactions for data integrity
- ✅ Indexes for query optimization
- ✅ Database seeding for development and testing

### 3. Frontend API Integration
- ✅ Centralized API client with interceptors for authentication
- ✅ Service modules for authentication, events, users, and uploads
- ✅ JWT token storage and management
- ✅ Loading and error states for all API interactions
- ✅ Form validation before API submission
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### 4. Updated Frontend Components
- ✅ **Authentication**:
  - Updated Login.js and Signup.js to use JWT authentication
  - Implemented AuthContext provider with token management
  - Created protected routes based on user roles
  
- ✅ **Event Management**:
  - Updated EventDetail.js to fetch event data and handle RSVPs
  - Refactored CreateEvent.js for API-based event creation
  - Modified DiscoveryFeed.js to use API-based filtering and pagination
  
- ✅ **User Features**:
  - Updated Profile.js to use API for user data
  - Implemented InterestedEvents.js to show user's RSVPs
  - Created dashboard views for event organizers

### 5. Navigation and Routing
- ✅ Implemented proper React Router navigation throughout the application
- ✅ Updated Navbar component with dynamic links based on authentication status
- ✅ Refactored EventCard to use React Router for event detail navigation
- ✅ Added route parameters for dynamic content (e.g., /event/:id)
- ✅ Implemented redirects after authentication
- ✅ Added navigation between related pages (profile to events, events to details, etc.)

## Documentation

Complete documentation has been created:
- ✅ Architecture documentation (`/documentation/architecture.md`)
- ✅ API documentation (`/documentation/api.md`) 
- ✅ Database schema documentation (`/documentation/database.md`)
- ✅ Deployment guide (`/documentation/deployment.md`)
- ✅ Project README (`/README.md`)

## How to Run

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL service
   # Create database named 'campusnex'
   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE campusnex"
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd campusnex
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Key API Endpoints

- **Authentication**:
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/signup
  - POST /api/auth/logout
  
- **Events**:
  - GET /api/events
  - GET /api/events/:id
  - POST /api/events
  - PUT /api/events/:id
  - POST /api/events/:id/rsvp
  
- **Users**:
  - GET /api/users/profile
  - PUT /api/users/profile
  - GET /api/users/events

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:

1. **Testing Implementation**:
   - Unit tests for frontend components
